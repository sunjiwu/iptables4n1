This is a port of netfilter/iptables 1.4.10 to the Android [Froyo](http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.2-highlights.html) branch. It can be built with Android Linux kernel branch [msm-2.6.32](http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=kernel/msm.git;a=summary). It was tested on a Nexus One. Only IPv4 support is provided at this time but IPv6 support is in progress. If you need IPv6 now, try your hand with this [patch](http://code.google.com/p/iptables4n1/issues/detail?id=1).
